# UI Programmer

Hi, I'm Èric Solà, the UI programmer of Duck Dev, and my contribution to this project have been:

* Create the UI [Art + Programming]
* Implement the Gamepad and the gamepad controls
* The Cutscenes system


## UI
This is the User interface, which is quite simple, but is enought to show the player what he have to know

* **Bars**

The first one shows the player's stamina and the second the final boss life. They are made to adapt to the values that it's showing. Even if you change the amount of stamina of the player the bar will always move inside the container.

* **Items Counters**

Counters are used to show the amount of items the player has. In this case you can see the rupees counter.

**Resume:** Return you to the game.
**Load:** Load the last checkpoint.

## Cutscenes

Cutscenes are the main way to show the story to the player. In these system we are able to move entities and UI elements, and also make player interact with the dialogues.
